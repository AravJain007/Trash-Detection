# Trash Detection for River Cleaning
## Overview

Welcome to the Trash Detection project, which has the potential to become a vital component of the larger AquaShark initiative aimed at cleaning rivers. This project focuses on the development of a robust Object Detection model specifically designed to identify and locate floating trash in Indian rivers. The model can be seamlessly integrated into river cleaning bots, such as AquaShark, to enhance their efficiency in waste removal.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Trash Detection:** Develop an accurate and reliable object detection model capable of identifying various types of trash commonly found floating in rivers.

2. **Integration:** Enable easy integration of the Trash Detection model into river cleaning bots, contributing to the overall effectiveness of AquaShark and similar projects.

3. **Dataset:** Utilize a curated and labeled dataset to train the model, ensuring a diverse range of trash objects for robust detection capabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the Trash Detection model was meticulously curated and labeled by the project creator. Roboflow was employed to streamline the dataset preparation process, ensuring high-quality annotations for optimal model performance.

## Model Training

The Object Detection model was trained using state-of-the-art techniques to achieve accurate and efficient trash detection. The training process involved optimizing the model for real-world scenarios commonly encountered in river environments.

## Usage

Integrating the Trash Detection model into your project is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AravJain007/Trash-Detection.git
   cd Trash-Detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Inference:**
   ```bash
   python detect_trash.py --input_image your_image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `your_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to analyze for trash.
