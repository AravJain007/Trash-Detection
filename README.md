# Trash-Detection
This project is solely focused on creating a robust Object Detection model for the detection of trash that is found floating in the river. It can be used as a part of a bigger Project such as for river cleaning bots like AquaShark. This model was trained on a dataset that was curated and labelled by me using Roboflow.
